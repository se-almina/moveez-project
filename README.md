## CEN 308 - Software Engineering

This is a course project built using the MERN stack and its online movie booking system (Moveez).

In this initial release, the following features are available:

- backend part is done with routes for CRUD operations and the database used is MongoDB
- API calls for routes `/movies` and `/singlemovie` for displaying movies on the home page
- API call for route `/singlemovie` for fetching a single movie based on the ID that takes the user to a new page where more info about the movie is displayed (this page is not finished for this version)
- basic frontend with header, footer and display of movies

The project is deployed using Netlify (frontend) and Render (backend) and it can be found on the following link:
